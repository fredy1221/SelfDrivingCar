# Self Driving Cars in Carla
Self driving car control in Carla simulator using DL techniques

## Project general overview
Self-driving cars are definitely coming into our day-to-day life sooner or later, and controlling them will be heavily impacted by AI and especially deep learning. The project consists of simulating a car in a virtual environment, where we can control it using AI. The main tasks are to design and test Deep Learning models for autonomous driving scenarios. Gather data from different sensors and join them to actuate commands from the Deep Learning module. A comparison will be made with classical computer vision techniques to see where the DL stands out and where the classical methods are enough.
