# Self Driving Car in Carla
Self driving car control in Carla simulator using DL techniques

## Project
Design and development of Deep Learning techniques for autonomous driving

## Pedagogic objectives:
Design, optimize and test Deep Learning models for autonomous driving scenarios. Gather data from different sensors and join them to actuate commands from the Deep Learning module.

## Scientific and technical objectives:
- Integrate different cameras in a computer vision pipeline while keeping minimal latency.
- Run model inference in real-time systems.
- Controlling self-driving cars by using data from different sensors.
- Choosing which type of sensor or camera to work with, based on certain requirements and constraints.
- Train, tune and evaluate Deep Learning models
- Work on Image Processing techniques
- Optimize ML algorithms
- Develop and run test scenarios
- Use of CARLA simulator jointly with a Deep Learning agent
